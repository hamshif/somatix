Somatix demonstrates using device sensors asynchronously
========================================================

Somatix uses rxjava2 so it is naturaly in a more functional than object oriented style. 

please make sure to build and run sensors.

Somatix has a sevice that writes sensor output to file in CSV format
--------------------------------------------------------------------
the file path is:

/sdcard/somatix.csv
